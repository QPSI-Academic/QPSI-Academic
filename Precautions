ARS Testing (Ability Rating Standard): 
A specialized test that dynamically tests the power level and presentable ESP abilities 
based on the participant’s responses and resilience during testing. This test helps measure 
the subject’s demonstrable ESP abilities in real-time and provides an enhancements 
framework for a more accurate, Consistency and stable assessment of their abilities. 
OCP (Outsourced Calculations Protocol) : 
The Outsourced Calculations Protocol (OCP) is designed specifically for participants who 
are unable to perform or manage quantum calculations independently using their own 
brain. This protocol leverages specialized devices incorporating advanced technology and 
materials, interfacing directly with brainwaves or electrodes to enhance computational 
support. Data generated through the OCP will be collected to monitor and support the 
ongoing development of each participant’s abilities.  
Participants opting to use the OCP should be aware that it involves an annual maintenance 
fee and may also require periodic system updates, including comprehensive system scans 
and medical evaluations, to ensure optimal functionality and safety. 
QBD (Quantum Brain Data): 
An advanced form of analysis that collects and interprets quantum data from brain activity, 
providing deeper insights into the brain’s response when using their ability. This data is 
instrumental in understanding how quantum states in the brain may work or alter ESP 
abilities in varying interference conditions. 
Thinking Pattern Analysis:   
A method for tracking and analyzing the cognitive processes that participants use when 
exposed to interference. This includes measuring brainwave patterns, decision-making 
speed, adaptability, and consistency, providing a comprehensive view of cognitive 
resilience under interference. 
Brain Calculations Method:   
Refers to the participant’s innate or trained capacity to cognitively or psionically process 
interference. This method tracks the brain’s real-time calculations or adjustments to 
external interference, helping to quantify cognitive adaptation and resilience in response to 
complex stimuli. 
BD (Battle Data):   
Data gathered during high-stress or high-intensity testing scenarios, often designed to 
simulate combative or extreme resistance conditions. This data is critical for 
understanding how ESP abilities respond under duress, offering insights into performance 
limits and potential recovery strategies. 
UD (Usage Data):   
Referring to data collected on the participant's use of ESP abilities over time, both within 
and outside the testing environment. Usage Data is essential for monitoring patterns in 
ability frequency, intensity, and effectiveness, providing a longitudinal view of ESP 
development and stability. 
System Scans: 
As part of the academy's commitment to safety and accuracy in psychic ability 
development, all participants are required to undergo an initial Body Check and System 
Shift before commencing any training or testing. This foundational assessment ensures 
that the participant's physiological and psychological baselines are accurately recorded, 
providing a reliable reference for their psychic development journey. 
Further requirements include: 
Level-Up Protocols: Whenever a participant achieves a new level or significant 
enhancement in their psychic abilities, they are required to undergo a System Scan and 
Body Check to assess any physiological or neural changes that may impact their stability or 
control.  
Data Recalibration: All System Scan data will be securely updated within the academy's 
database, ensuring the participant’s records remain accurate. This recalibration process 
aids in monitoring growth trajectories and detecting any anomalies that may arise from 
accelerated development. 
Continuous Monitoring and Safety Assurance: These regular checkups ensure that any 
risks associated with increased power levels are identified and addressed promptly, 
supporting a safe and effective environment for advanced ability training. 
Precautions 
QBD, Thinking Pattern, Brain Calculations Method, Battle Data, ARS Test, and Usage 
Data will be collected for experiment research and abilities enhancement.  
The DATA collected will be used in the development of OCP (Outsourced Calculations 
Protocol). 
Participants will receive special formular enhancement after awakening their psychic 
ability. 
Every Esper must take responsibility for their own actions and psychic abilities. 
External stimulation is required for the development of psychic abilities.
